![CSS Cat Preview](Capture4.PNG)

This project is a **CSS art illustration of a cat's face**, created using only **HTML and CSS**, inspired by a freeCodeCamp challenge. Every part of the cat — including its ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers — is made entirely from `div` elements, CSS shapes, and styling.
